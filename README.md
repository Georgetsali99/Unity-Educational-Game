# Unity-Educational-Game
My thesis project made in Unity 3d. Its more like a proof of concept than a complete game

It took 1 and a half years to complete, mostly because i had to learn C# from scratch and Unity was bugging constantly (also that was the time limit I had to submit my thesis).
================================================================================================================================================================================
IMPORTANT: the game is not finished! Only 4 out of the 6 planned chapters are available and in most of them there are a lot of missing textures and many of the assets where made very quickly(character models, images) because of time constrains.
Also, the game is in Greek,I was planing to add english aswell, but because of time constrains it never happend.
================================================================================================================================================================================

The project itself is impossible to upload here because its 20GB, So i will explain as much as possible.

The goal of this project was to teach Greek mythology through an interactive Game to primary school students. The project is made in Unity and the main programming language used is C#.

Programs used: Unity,Blender,Clip Studio Paint

The game consists of a prologue which covers the Clash of the Titans and 4 otner Chapters covering the stories of:
1)Prometheus and the Gift of Fire/ Pandora's box / Deucalion and Pyrrha
2) The twelve labours of Hercules
